# sed_fit
IDL code for SED fitting of extincted and/or low-mass stars


The main driver is gcal_missing.pro. Inside of that, you will find the function "IRAS", which is for fitting the Taurus-Auriga planet host. 

This assumes you have common IDL packages including queryvizier and CG (Coyote Graphics). Other required pieces should be included.
